# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## 0.1.0 - Not yet released
* First release that can be expected to work reasonably reliable.

## 0.0.2 - Not yet released
* This project is still very much in its early stages!
* Re-implemented the [LibreNMS API](https://docs.librenms.org/API/]) documentation parser using the [Mistune](https://mistune.lepture.com/en/latest/index.html) library.
* Unfortunately some Markdown files of the LibreNMS API documentation fail to parse at the moment so they are currently not supported.
* Fixed a bug where POST and PATCH methods didn't actually work.

## 0.0.1 - 22-Nov-2025
* Initial release.
* Matches current documentation of the LibreNMS API but there is
  zero real-life experience with this library.
* USE WITH CAUTION!
